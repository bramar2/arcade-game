# arcade-game: Arcade game made with C++ using SDL3
## Info
The project unfortunately has missing assets that cannot be inserted due to legal copyright reasons, so by default it will not be able to run properly. For those reasons, you will need to insert these assets manually. Note that the project owner does not condone the use of copyrighted assets in this project. The assets you need to add are blocks/\*.cpp, logo/*.cpp, and sound/*.cpp. All assets should be in the format of WAV (audio) or BMP (image). You can use `xxd` tool to help with inserting the assets.
## Dependencies
- SDL3
- SDL3_ttf
- bramar2/json (custom)
## Building
On root, run the following commands:
- `cmake -S . -B build/`
- `cmake --build build/`


The executable should be in build/arcade-game.exe. Make sure you have SDL3 and SDL3_ttf installed.

## Preview
